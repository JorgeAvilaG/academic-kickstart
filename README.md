# [Personal Webpage - Jorge √Åvila](https://jorgeavilag.github.io/)

This is the repository with the files to generate my personal webpage. It is created using the Hugo static site generator and using the academic template.

**Academic** makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio. Customize anything on the site with widgets, themes, and language packs. [Check it out](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/)
