title: "Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells"
event: "ESMolNa 2015"

location: Paris, France
summary:
abstract: "In this work, efficient methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite-based solar cells are prepared in which the perovskite layer is sandwiched in between two organic charge transporting layers. The difference in energy between these selective layers and the perovskite lead to an effective blocking of electrons and holes respectively. This configuration leads to stable and reproducible devices that do not suffer from strong hysteresis effects and when optimized lead to efficiencies close to 15%.
The perovskite layer is formed by using a dual-source thermal evaporation method, whereas the organic layers are processed from solution. The dual-source thermal evaporation method leads to smooth films and allows for high precision thickness variations.
Here, we study how the different characteristic parameters change with the perovskite layer thickness and how we can improve the efficiency through optimizing the charge transport selective layers. We demonstrate that slightly oxidized electron blocking layer, the fill factor increases for the solar cells with a perovskite layer thickness of 900 nm up to the same values as for the devices with thin perovskite layers.
This fact place the perovskite as a promising material for industrialization, where these types of solar cells do not require an accurate thickness control because of its excellent properties remains in a broad range of perovskite thickness.
