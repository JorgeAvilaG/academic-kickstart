title: "Monolithic perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells"
event: "RSEQ bienal 2017"
event_url: "http://geqo.es/xxxvi-reunion-bienal-de-la-real-sociedad-espanola-de-quimica/"
location: "Sitges, Spain"  
summary:
abstract: "Metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials, with record efficiencies beyond 20%. Perovskite solar cells, mostly employ solution processed perovskite layers. Evaporated methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films have also been reported and been employed in solar cells. Our group has developed several perovskite solar cells, using vacuum deposition methods. These metal oxide free perovskite cells exhibit high power-conversion efficiencies. We will present our work on fully evaporated perovskite devices reaching power conversion efficiencies as high as 20 % in a planar device.
Additionally, we present the preparation and characterization of perovskite films (Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(BrxI1-x)3) suitable as wide bandgap (2.0 eV) absorber for tandem applications. Using a multi-layer stack employing different perovskite films and organic transport layers allows us to prepare tandem solar cells with high efficiency and open circuit voltage above 2.3 V."
