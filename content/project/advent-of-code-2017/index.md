[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I have been using them to improve my coding experience and my knowledge in algorithms. I have participated in the 2017 and 2018 editions completing all the problems. Here I present my solutions for the year 2017, I have tried to develop clear python scripts that lead to the solutions in a efficient and easy way (almost always :D). I am trying to create useful contents related with the problems, for example the featured image in this post is the day 14 solution visualization.

I am really anxious for the 2019 edition and I am planning to create jupyter notebooks for the solution of each day, explaining clearly the code and working on the visualization or interesting stuff related with each problem.
