[//]: # (3D printing have been shown as a incredible useful tool for my research activities. I have been using mainly OPENSCAD and BLABLA while I finnaly have been using blabla. You can find in the github repository different pieces that I have design and the description about for what are they for. Who knows maybe you find then useful and inspiractional. I need to add the url to the git hub repository with my 3D designs.)
