abstract: "Solar panels easily heat up upon intense solar radiation due to excess energy dissipation of the absorbed photons or by nonradiative recombination of charge carriers. Still, photoinduced self-heating is often ignored when characterizing lab-sized samples. For light-intensity-dependent measurements of the open-circuit voltage (Suns-VOC), allowing us to characterize the recombination mechanism, sample heating is often not considered, although almost 100% of the absorbed energy is converted into heat. Here, we show that the frequently observed stagnation or even decrease in VOC at increasingly high light intensities can be explained by considering an effective electrothermal feedback between the recombination current and the open-circuit voltage. Our analytical model fully explains the experimental data for various solar-cell technologies, comprising conventional inorganic semiconductors as well as organic and perovskite materials. Furthermore, the model can be exploited to determine the ideality factor, the effective gap, and the temperature rise from a single Suns-VOC measurement at ambient conditions."
