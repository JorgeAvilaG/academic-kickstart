abstract: "In this work we study the band gap variation and properties of the perovskite compound Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(BrxI1−x)3 as a function of the halide composition, with the aim of developing an efficient complementary absorber for MAPbI3 in all-perovskite tandem devices. We have found the perovskite stoichiometry Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(Br0.7I0.3)3 to be a promising candidate, thanks to its band gap of approximately 2 eV. Single junction devices using this perovskite absorber lead to a maximum PCE of 11.5%, among the highest reported for solar cells using perovskites with a band gap wider than 1.8 eV."
