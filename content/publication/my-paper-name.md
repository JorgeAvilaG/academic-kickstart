abstract: "The diode behavior of photovoltaic devices based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskites is examined, in combination with electroluminescence measurements. From this analysis the diode ideality factors are extracted, which indicate that non‐radiative trap‐assisted recombination is the dominant recombination pathway, primarily caused by the presence of electron traps."
