While previous modeling studies focused on a single experimental technique, we combine steady-state, transient, and frequency-domain simulations and measurements. Our study is an important step toward quantitative simulation of perovskite solar cells, leading to a deeper understanding of the physical effects in these materials. The analysis of the transient current upon voltage turn-on in the dark reveals that the charge injection properties of the interfaces are triggered by the accumulation of mobile ionic defects. We show that the current rise of voltage step experiments allow for conclusions about the recombination at the interface. Whether one or two mobile ionic species are used in the model has only a minor influence on the observed effects. A delayed current rise observed upon reversing the bias from +3 to ‚àí3 V in the dark cannot be reproduced yet by our drift-diffusion model. We speculate that a reversible chemical reaction of mobile ions with the contact material may be the cause of this effect, thus requiring a future model extension.

Using optically flat and well controlled vapor phase deposited layers, the optical constants of all layers in a tandem solar cell were determined. These results were employed to calculate the ideal configuration for a tandem cell based on two sub-cells with the same perovskite absorber.

In most of the reported high efficiency vapor deposited perovskite solar cells the perovskite absorber layer is sandwiched in between charge selective transport layers. The conductivity of these layers is frequently enhanced by ‚Äúdoping‚Äù them with additives that lead to an excess of charge concentration. Key advantages of using doped layers classically include reduced series resistance and the formation of ohmic contacts to the external electrodes, both enhancing the fill factor of the cells. The main drawback, however, lies in the stability of the devices, which can be reduced when doped layers are employed. Here, we study the influence of the doped and undoped transport layers on fully evaporated p-i-n devices. We propose a strategy to improve stability and efficiency by removing the doped layers in a series of different layouts. The use of undoped transport layers on the n-side notably enhances the stability. On the other hand, the use of undoped transport layers on the p-side lead to higher current densities. On average 18 % of power conversion efficiency was reached, improving the stability and reliability of fully evaporated perovskite solar cells.","tags":[],"title":"Influence of doped charge transport layers on efficient perovskite solar cells","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sascha Ullbrich","Axel Fischer","Zheng Tang","Jorge √Åvila","Henk J Bolink","Sebastian Reineke","Koen Vandewal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"ea88006bd268e142dbd24d30c8f1524b","permalink":"https://www.uv.es/jorpago/publication/phys-rev-applied-9-051003/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T10:48:55.471715Z","relpermalink":"/jorpago/publication/phys-rev-applied-9-051003/","section":"publication","summary":"Solar panels easily heat up upon intense solar radiation due to excess energy dissipation of the absorbed photons or by nonradiative recombination of charge carriers.

However, as yet, no evaluation of their amenability and justification for the use of the results for the above-noted purposes has been reported. To check if we can learn from pulsed measurement results about steady-state phototransport properties, we show here that, although pulsed measurements can be useful to extract information on the recombination kinetics of HaPs, great care should be taken. One issue is that no changes in the material are induced during or as a result of the excitation, and another one concerns in how far pulsed excitation-derived data can be used to find relevant steady-state parameters. To answer the latter question, we revisited pulsed excitation and propose a novel way to compare between pulsed and steady state measurements at different excitation intensities. We performed steady-state photoconductivity and ambipolar diffusion length measurements, as well as pulsed time-resolved microwave conductivity and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements as a function of excitation intensity on the same samples of different MAPbI3 thin films, and found good quasi-quantitative agreement between the results, explaining them with a generalized single level recombination model that describes the basic physics of phototransport of HaP absorbers. Moreover, we find the first experimental manifestation of the boundaries between several effective recombination regimes that exist in HaPs, by analyzing their phototransport behavior as a function of excitation intensity.","tags":null,"title":"Can we use time-resolved measurements to get steady-state transport data for halide perovskites?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jorge √Åvila","Cristina Momblona","Pablo Boix","Michele Sessolo","Miguel Anaya","Gabriel Lozano","Koen Vandewal","Hern√°n M√≠guez","Henk J Bolink"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"90cf25c4442abc1e6b25fe7f51adcedb","permalink":"https://www.uv.es/jorpago/publication/avila-2018/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T10:48:55.419365Z","relpermalink":"/jorpago/publication/avila-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The recent success of perovskite solar cells is based on two solid pillars: the rapid progress of their power conversion efficiency and their flexibility in terms of optoelectrical properties and processing methods.

Despite the non-ideal combination of bandgaps in the two subcells, we demonstrate perovskite-perovskite tandem cells delivering an average PCE of 15%, with a maximum efficiency obtained of 18%.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient wide band gap hybrid perovskites for monolithic tandem solar cells","type":"talk"},{"authors":["D√°vid Forg√°cs","Daniel P√©rez-del-Rey","Jorge √Åvila","Cristina Momblona","Lid√≥n Gil-Escrig","Benedikt D√§nekamp","Michele Sessolo","Henk J Bolink"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"3f8d0a43e22e21c08b92b67504988af0","permalink":"https://www.uv.es/jorpago/publication/c-6-ta-10727-c/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T10:48:55.376382Z","relpermalink":"/jorpago/publication/c-6-ta-10727-c/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work we study the band gap variation and properties of the perovskite compound Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(BrxI1‚àíx)3 as a function of the halide composition, with the aim of developing an efficient complementary absorber for MAPbI3 in all-perovskite tandem devices.

The ease of fabrication has favored the adoption of lab-scale solution-processing techniques, which have yielded the highest performing devices. Most of these processes, however, are not directly applicable to larger scale and volume preparations, hindering the consolidation and market entry of this technology. Vapor-based methods, a mature technology widely adopted in the coating and semiconductor industry, could change this trend. Their application to perovskite solar cells includes a large amount of fabrication approaches, offering versatility in the employed materials as well as in the characteristics of the resulting perovskite films. It is thus essential to review the fundamentals of perovskite vapor-related techniques in order to put their real potential and challenges into perspective.","tags":["photovoltaics","tandem solar cells","vapor deposition","metal-halide perovskites"],"title":"Vapor-Deposited Perovskites: The Route to High-Performance Solar Cell Production?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Bandiello","Jorge √Åvila","Lid√≥n Gil-Escrig","Eelco Tekelenburg","Michele Sessolo","Henk J Bolink"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"77eb816d3c996614766b49f1d6e0d548","permalink":"https://www.uv.es/jorpago/publication/c-6-ta-06854-e/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T10:48:55.369381Z","relpermalink":"/jorpago/publication/c-6-ta-06854-e/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we study the effect of voltage bias on the optoelectronic behavior of methylammonium lead iodide planar diodes. Upon biasing the diodes with a positive voltage, the turn-on voltage of the electroluminescence diminishes and its intensity substantially increases. This behavior is reminiscent of that observed in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), single-layer electroluminescent devices in which the charge injection is assisted by the accumulation of ions at the electrode interface. Because of this mechanism, performances are largely independent from the work function of the electrodes. The similarities observed between planar perovskite diodes and LECs suggest that mobile ions in the perovskite do play an important role in device operation. Besides enhanced electroluminescence, biasing these devices can also result in improved photovoltaic performance.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of mobile ions on the electroluminescence characteristics of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite diodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gilbert El-Hajje","Cristina Momblona","Lid√≥n Gil-Escrig","Jorge √Åvila","Thomas Guillemot","Jean-Fran√ßois Guillemoles","Michele Sessolo","Henk J Bolink","Laurent Lombez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"51b3c94f9de8abc53e9ef1fb72397d83","permalink":"https://www.uv.es/jorpago/publication/c-6-ee-00462-h/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T10:48:55.362402Z","relpermalink":"/jorpago/publication/c-6-ee-00462-h/","section":"publication","summary":"Vacuum evaporated perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 15% have been characterized using hyperspectral luminescence imaging. Hyperspectral luminescence imaging is a novel technique that offers spectrally resolved photoluminescence and electroluminescence maps (spatial resolution is 2 micrometer) on an absolute scale. This allows, using the generalized Planck's law, the construction of absolute maps of the depth-averaged quasi-Fermi level splitting (ŒîŒº), which determines the maximum achievable open circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells. In a similar way, using the generalized reciprocity relations the charge transfer efficiency of the cells can be obtained from the hyperspectral images. Very strong inhomogeneity, both in quasi-Fermi level splitting (ŒîŒº) and in charge transfer efficiency, are found in these vacuum deposited perovskite solar cells. This implies that these efficient solar cells are still far from perfect as many areas in the device do not or only partially participate in the photon to electron conversion processes.","tags":null,"title":"Quantification of spatial inhomogeneity in perovskite solar cells by hyperspectral luminescence imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J. √Åvila","C.

The difference in energy between these selective layers and the perovskite lead to an effective blocking of electrons and holes respectively. This configuration leads to stable and reproducible devices that do not suffer from strong hysteresis effects and when optimized lead to efficiencies close to 15%. The perovskite layer is formed by using a dual-source thermal evaporation method, whereas the organic layers are processed from solution. The dual-source thermal evaporation method leads to smooth films and allows for high precision thickness variations. Here, we study how the different characteristic parameters change with the perovskite layer thickness and how we can improve the efficiency through optimizing the charge transport selective layers. We demonstrate that slightly oxidized electron blocking layer, the fill factor increases for the solar cells with a perovskite layer thickness of 900 nm up to the same values as for the devices with thin perovskite layers. This fact place the perovskite as a promising material for industrialization, where these types of solar cells do not require an accurate thickness control because of its excellent properties remains in a broad range of perovskite thickness.
