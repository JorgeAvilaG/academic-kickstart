abstract = {Vacuum evaporated perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 15{\%} have been characterized using hyperspectral luminescence imaging. Hyperspectral luminescence imaging is a novel technique that offers spectrally resolved photoluminescence and electroluminescence maps (spatial resolution is 2 micrometer) on an absolute scale. This allows{\{},{\}} using the generalized Planck's law{\{},{\}} the construction of absolute maps of the depth-averaged quasi-Fermi level splitting ($\Delta$$\mu$){\{},{\}} which determines the maximum achievable open circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells. In a similar way{\{},{\}} using the generalized reciprocity relations the charge transfer efficiency of the cells can be obtained from the hyperspectral images. Very strong inhomogeneity{\{},{\}} both in quasi-Fermi level splitting ($\Delta$$\mu$) and in charge transfer efficiency{\{},{\}} are found in these vacuum deposited perovskite solar cells. This implies that these efficient solar cells are still far from perfect as many areas in the device do not or only partially participate in the photon to electron conversion processes.},

abstract = {Trap-assisted recombination, despite being lower as compared with traditional inorganic solar cells, is still the dominant recombination mechanism in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and limits their efficiency. We investigate the attributes of the primary trap-assisted recombination channels (grain boundaries and interfaces) and their correlation to defect ions in PSCs. We achieve this by using a validated device model to fit the simulations to the experimental data of efficient vacuum-deposited p–i–n and n–i–p CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, including the light intensity dependence of the open-circuit voltage and fill factor. We find that, despite the presence of traps at interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), their neutral (when filled with photogenerated charges) disposition along with the long-lived nature of holes leads to the high performance of PSCs. The sign of the traps (when filled) is of little importance in efficient solar cells with compact morphologies (fused GBs, low trap density). On the other hand, solar cells with noncompact morphologies (open GBs, high trap density) are sensitive to the sign of the traps and hence to the cell preparation methods. Even in the presence of traps at GBs, trap-assisted recombination at interfaces (between the transport layers and the perovskite) is the dominant loss mechanism. We find a direct correlation between the density of traps, the density of mobile ionic defects, and the degree of hysteresis observed in the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The presence of defect states or mobile ions not only limits the device performance but also plays a role in the J–V hysteresis.},

abstract = {A series of monoanionic Ir(III) complexes (2–4) of general formula [Ir(C{\^{}}N)2(b-trz)](TBA) are presented, where C{\^{}}N indicates three different cyclometallating ligands (Hppy = 2-phenylpyridine; Hdfppy = 2-(2,4-difluoro-phenyl)pyridine; Hpqu = 2-methyl-3-phenylquinoxaline), b-trz is a bis-tetrazolate anionic N{\^{}}N chelator (H2b-trz = di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)methane), and TBA = tetrabutylammonium. 2–4 are prepared in good yields by means of the reaction of the suitable b-trz bidentate ligand with the desired iridium(III) precursor. The chelating nature of the ancillary ligand, thanks to an optimized structure and geometry, improves the stability of the complexes, which have been fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution MS, while X-ray structure determination confirmed the binding mode of the b-trz ligand. Density functional theory calculations show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are mainly localized on the metal center and the cyclometalating ligands, while the bis-tetrazolate unit does not contribute to the frontier orbitals. By comparison with selected classes of previously published cationic and anionic complexes with high ligand field and even identical cyclometallating moieties, it is shown that the HOMO–LUMO gap is similar, but the absolute energy of the frontier orbitals is remarkably higher for anionic vs cationic compounds, due to electrostatic effects. 2–4 exhibit reversible oxidation and reduction processes, which make them interesting candidates as active materials for light emitting electrochemical cells, along with red, green, and blue emission, thanks to the design of the C{\^{}}N ligands. Photoluminescence quantum yields range from 28{\%} (4, C{\^{}}N = pqu, red emitter) to 83{\%} (3, C{\^{}}N = dfppy, blue emitter) in acetonitrile, with the latter compound reaching 95{\%} in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. In thin films, the photoluminescence quantum yield decreases substantially probably due to the small intersite distance between the complexes and the presence of quenching sites. In spite of this, surprisingly stable electroluminescence was observed for devices employing complex 2, demonstrating the robustness of the anionic compounds.},

abstract = {Summary
High-quality semiconducting perovskites can be easily synthesized through several methods. The ease of fabrication has favored the adoption of lab-scale solution-processing techniques, which have yielded the highest performing devices. Most of these processes, however, are not directly applicable to larger scale and volume preparations, hindering the consolidation and market entry of this technology. Vapor-based methods, a mature technology widely adopted in the coating and semiconductor industry, could change this trend. Their application to perovskite solar cells includes a large amount of fabrication approaches, offering versatility in the employed materials as well as in the characteristics of the resulting perovskite films. It is thus essential to review the fundamentals of perovskite vapor-related techniques in order to put their real potential and challenges into perspective.},

abstract = {The recent success of perovskite solar cells is based on two solid pillars: the rapid progress of their power conversion efficiency and their flexibility in terms of optoelectrical properties and processing methods. That versatility makes these devices ideal candidates for multi-junction photovoltaics. We report an optically optimized double junction CH3NH3PbI3–CH3NH3PbI3 tandem solar cell where the matched short-circuit current is maximized while parasitic absorption is minimized. The use of an additive vacuum-deposition protocol allows us to reproduce calculated stack designs, which comprise several charge selective materials that ensure appropriate band alignment and charge recombination. This rationalized configuration yields an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 2.30 V. Furthermore, this tandem solar cell features efficiencies larger than 18{\%}, higher than those of the individual sub-cells. Low photo-current values allow reducing the losses associated to the series resistance of transparent contacts, which opens the door to the realization of efficient large area modules.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Author(s). Time-resolved, pulsed excitation methods are widely used to deduce optoelectronic properties of semiconductors, including now also Halide Perovskites (HaPs), especially transport properties. However, as yet, no evaluation of their amenability and justification for the use of the results for the above-noted purposes has been reported. To check if we can learn from pulsed measurement results about steady-state phototransport properties, we show here that, although pulsed measurements can be useful to extract information on the recombination kinetics of HaPs, great care should be taken. One issue is that no changes in the material are induced during or as a result of the excitation, and another one concerns in how far pulsed excitation-derived data can be used to find relevant steady-state parameters. To answer the latter question, we revisited pulsed excitation and propose a novel way to compare between pulsed and steady state measurements at different excitation intensities. We performed steady-state photoconductivity and ambipolar diffusion length measurements, as well as pulsed time-resolved microwave conductivity and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements as a function of excitation intensity on the same samples of different MAPbI3 thin films, and found good quasi-quantitative agreement between the results, explaining them with a generalized single level recombination model that describes the basic physics of phototransport of HaP absorbers. Moreover, we find the first experimental manifestation of the boundaries between several effective recombination regimes that exist in HaPs, by analyzing their phototransport behavior as a function of excitation intensity.},

abstract = {A variety of experiments on vacuum-deposited methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells are presented, including JV curves with different scan rates, light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage, impedance spectra, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectra, transient photocurrents, and transient voltage step responses. All these experimental data sets are successfully reproduced by a charge drift-diffusion simulation model incorporating mobile ions and charge traps using a single set of parameters. While previous modeling studies focused on a single experimental technique, we combine steady-state, transient, and frequency-domain simulations and measurements. Our study is an important step toward quantitative simulation of perovskite solar cells, leading to a deeper understanding of the physical effects in these materials. The analysis of the transient current upon voltage turn-on in the dark reveals that the charge injection properties of the interfaces are triggered by the accumulation of mobile ionic defects. We show that the current rise of voltage step experiments allow for conclusions about the recombination at the interface. Whether one or two mobile ionic species are used in the model has only a minor influence on the observed effects. A delayed current rise observed upon reversing the bias from +3 to −3 V in the dark cannot be reproduced yet by our drift-diffusion model. We speculate that a reversible chemical reaction of mobile ions with the contact material may be the cause of this effect, thus requiring a future model extension. A parameter variation is performed in order to understand the performance-limiting factors of the device under investigation.},
